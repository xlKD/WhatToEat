# WhatToEat
My wife usually got confused choosing what to cook each day, and so was I. As the husband and also the only developer in the family, I realized that this decision making cost is too much and negatively affects our family atmosphere...

And that is why I made this app. It doesn't do very much, but thank React Native team anyway for such an interesting and refreshing mobile app development experience.
